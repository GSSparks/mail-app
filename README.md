# The Unofficial Google Apps ... App

This is a simple python wrapper using the PyQt5 libraries that will display your Gmail, Google calendar, and maps. This project came about to make using Google apps easier for me from my desktop for work. More apps may be added if I come to use them frequently in the future. 

## Benefits of using this over web browser:

* Dedicated use.
  * Keeps you logged in even on restarts until you log out. 
  * Automatically Loads on start.
* Isolated from other browsing.
  * You can run two instances with two different Gmail accounts.
  * Links open in system's default web browser.
